# Generative AI

## What It Is
Built on Transformers to generate text, code, and images. For enterprises, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the most valuable pattern.

## RAG Pattern (Conceptual)
1) Retrieve relevant enterprise knowledge → 2) Compose with query → 3) Constrain model to cited context → 4) Generate grounded answers

## Use Cases
- HR: Draft reviews, policies, job descriptions
- Legal: Contract templates, drafting assistance
- Finance: Narrative reporting, budget justifications
- Admin: Meeting summaries, process documentation

## Developer Snapshot
- Difficulty: Medium; focus on prompts, RAG, LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning, evaluation
- Data & Cost: 1K+ high-quality examples for tuning; integrate eval & guardrails
