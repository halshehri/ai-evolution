# Evaluation & Guardrails

## Core Practices
- Privacy by design: PII handling, access controls, redaction
- Observability: prompts, inputs/outputs, latency, cost, drift
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL): review critical outputs; escalation paths
- Rollback points: versioned models/pipelines; safe deploys

## Evaluation
- Offline eval: test sets, metrics per use case
- Online eval: A/B, canaries, feedback loops
- Safety eval: jailbreak tests, toxicity/PII checks, refusal policies
