# Classic Machine Learning

## 2.1 Supervised Learning — Predict with Labels
Train on input-output pairs to learn a predictive function.
- Use cases: Attrition prediction, resume screening, risk scoring, demand forecasting
- Difficulty: Medium; needs feature engineering and validation
- Data & Cost: 1K+ labeled examples; $50K–200K typical
- Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, ROC; avoid overfitting

## 2.2 Unsupervised Learning — Discover Structure
Find clusters, anomalies, or patterns without labels.
- Use cases: Employee/vendor segmentation, anomaly detection, log analysis
- Difficulty: Medium; validation depends on domain judgment
- Data & Cost: Larger unlabeled datasets (10K+); $40K–150K

## 2.3 Reinforcement Learning — Learn via Feedback
Agent optimizes a reward through interaction. High-risk/high-reward; mostly experimental in enterprises.
- Use cases: Dynamic resource allocation, logistics, pricing (advanced)
- Difficulty: Very High; needs simulation environments
- Cost & Timeline: $300K–$1M+, 6–24 months

## When to Use / Avoid
- Use: Historical labeled data with structured/tabular inputs; 70–85% accuracy still valuable
- Avoid: No labels, perfect accuracy required, or unstructured text/images (see deep learning)
