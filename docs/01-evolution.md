## Evolution Timeline (At a Glance)
- 1970s-1980s: Rule-Based Systems — deterministic and auditable; strong for compliance and policy enforcement.
- 1990s-2010s: Machine Learning — learns from data; supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement paradigms.
- 2010s: Deep Learning — excels on unstructured data (images, text, audio); CNNs and RNN/LSTMs.
- 2017: Transformers — attention mechanism enables long-context reasoning; foundation for modern LLMs.
- 2020s: Generative AI — LLMs, code generation models, diffusion for images, and multimodal models.

## Pragmatic Path
- Start with the simplest method that works: Rule-Based → Classic ML → Deep Learning → GenAI.
- Adapt strong pre-trained models before inventing your own architectures.
- Define quality, latency, and cost targets; evaluate continuously.
- Build evaluation harnesses and guardrails early; use representative enterprise data safely.
- Enforce privacy by design with strong observability.
