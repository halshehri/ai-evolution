# Deep Learning

## Feedforward Networks
- Best for complex non-linear tabular data when classic ML plateaus
- Needs larger datasets (50K+) and careful regularization

## CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- Images and document processing (OCR, classification, QC)
- Prefer transfer learning; 1Kâ€“10K images per class

## RNNs/LSTMs (Sequential)
- Time series and sequences; many NLP tasks now replaced by Transformers
- Start with Prophet/ARIMA for forecasting baselines

## When to Use / Avoid
- Use: Unstructured data (images, signals), or when small gains have high value
- Avoid: Small datasets, tight interpretability requirements, quick turnaround needs
