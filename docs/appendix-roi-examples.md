# Appendix: ROI Examples

Consolidated examples from archived sources (`archive/sources/*`). Values are illustrative; adapt to your org’s rates and volumes.

## Rule-Based — HR Benefits Processing
- Baseline: ~15 minutes per enrollment; 200 enrollments/month; $50/hour labor
- Automation: ~2 minutes per enrollment → ~43 hours saved/month (~$2,150)
- Annual Savings: ~$25,800; Build Cost: ~$20,000 → ~129% first‑year ROI

## Supervised ML — HR Attrition Prediction
- Turnover Cost: ~$75,000 per employee; Historical: ~50 exits/year
- Intervention: Prevent 9 exits via early actions (60% of 15 targeted)
- Annual Savings: ~9 × $75,000 = ~$675,000
- Costs: ~$120,000 build + ~$30,000 annual maintenance → ~350% first‑year ROI

## Supervised ML — Finance Fraud Detection
- Historical Fraud Losses: ~$500,000 annually; Model catches ~85%
- Prevented Losses: ~$425,000; False-positive triage savings: ~$50,000
- Total Benefit: ~$475,000; Build Cost: ~$150,000 → ~217% first‑year ROI

## CNN + OCR — Receipt Processing Automation
- Time: 5 min → 45 sec per receipt; Volume: ~500/month
- Savings: ~37 hours/month at $25/hour = ~$925/month; + ~$200/month error reduction
- Annual Savings: ~$13,500; Build Cost: ~$120,000 → Negative year‑1; positive thereafter (infrastructure investment)

## Transformers — Contract Analysis Copilot
- Speedup: Significant drafting/review acceleration with HITL
- Example: Annual savings on order of ~$262,500 vs ~$200,000 build → ~31% first‑year ROI; ~131% in subsequent years

## Unsupervised ML — Employee Segmentation
- Outcomes: ~40% improvement in targeted HR interventions; ~15% improvement in retention; ~25% improvement in training effectiveness
- Costs/Benefits: ~$80K development; ~$200K annual benefit → ~150% first‑year ROI

## Unsupervised ML — Fraud Anomaly Triage
- Detection: Catch ~30% more fraud than rules; 50% fewer manual investigations
- Annual Benefit: ~$300K prevented losses + ~$75K investigation savings; Build: ~$100K → ~275% first‑year ROI

## Deep Learning — Document Digitization (Legal)
- Throughput: ~90% faster than manual digitization; Volume: ~1,000 docs/month
- Time saved: ~150 hours/month × $75/hour = ~$11,250/month → ~$135,000/year
- Costs: ~$200,000 build → ~‑33% in year 1; ~68% annually thereafter

## Reinforcement Learning — Realistic ROI Timeline
- Year 1: Typically negative due to high development/simulation costs
- Years 2–3: Break‑even if implementation successful
- Year 3+: Significant ROI possible for complex optimization problems

## Reinforcement Learning — Supply Chain Optimization
- Baseline: ~$10M annual inventory costs
- Impact: ~15% cost reduction → ~$1.5M annual savings
- Costs: ~$800K build over 18 months + ~$200K/year maintenance → ~62% ROI by year 3 (if successful)
