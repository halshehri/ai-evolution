# Appendix: ROI Examples

Consolidated examples from archived sources (`archive/sources/*`). Values are illustrative; adapt to your org’s rates and volumes.

## Rule-Based — HR Benefits Processing
- Baseline: ~15 minutes per enrollment; 200 enrollments/month; $50/hour labor
- Automation: ~2 minutes per enrollment → ~43 hours saved/month (~$2,150)
- Annual Savings: ~$25,800; Build Cost: ~$20,000 → ~129% first‑year ROI

## Supervised ML — HR Attrition Prediction
- Turnover Cost: ~$75,000 per employee; Historical: ~50 exits/year
- Intervention: Prevent 9 exits via early actions (60% of 15 targeted)
- Annual Savings: ~9 × $75,000 = ~$675,000
- Costs: ~$120,000 build + ~$30,000 annual maintenance → ~350% first‑year ROI

## Supervised ML — Finance Fraud Detection
- Historical Fraud Losses: ~$500,000 annually; Model catches ~85%
- Prevented Losses: ~$425,000; False-positive triage savings: ~$50,000
- Total Benefit: ~$475,000; Build Cost: ~$150,000 → ~217% first‑year ROI

## CNN + OCR — Receipt Processing Automation
- Time: 5 min → 45 sec per receipt; Volume: ~500/month
- Savings: ~37 hours/month at $25/hour = ~$925/month; + ~$200/month error reduction
- Annual Savings: ~$13,500; Build Cost: ~$120,000 → Negative year‑1; positive thereafter (infrastructure investment)

## Transformers — Contract Analysis Copilot
- Speedup: Significant drafting/review acceleration with HITL
- Example: Annual savings on order of ~$262,500 vs ~$200,000 build → ~31% first‑year ROI; ~131% in subsequent years
