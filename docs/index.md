# AI Evolution for Enterprise Developers — Guide

## Preface
This booklet is designed for experienced enterprise developers—professionals working on HR, Finance, Procurement, Legal, Admin, and internal IT systems. It provides a complete readout of AI's progression, from rule-based systems to generative AI, to help you become an effective AI implementer.

We emphasize history, capabilities, trade-offs, developer difficulty, resource requirements, key open-source tooling, and realistic business outcomes. This is not a buyer’s guide for closed APIs; it’s a builder’s guide for assembling reliable systems via open-source technologies.

You are uniquely positioned to improve internal business processes and employee productivity. This guide provides the technical foundation, business framework, and practical roadmap to succeed.

## How to Use This Guide
- Start with Evolution for a shared mental model of the space.
- Pick the chapter matching your needs (Rule-Based, Classic ML, Deep Learning, Transformers, Generative AI).
- Use the Tooling and Decision Trees to choose approaches and libraries.
- Apply Evaluation & Guardrails early (privacy, observability, HITL, rollback).
- Refer to ROI Examples to frame business value and adoption.
