# Rule-Based Systems (Symbolic AI)

## What They Are
Explicitly encoded human logic (if-then rules) rather than learned models. Deterministic and auditable; ideal for compliance and policy enforcement.

## Enterprise Use Cases
- HR: Benefits eligibility, policy enforcement, onboarding routing
- Finance: Expense approvals, invoice rules, basic fraud flags
- Procurement: Vendor selection trees, PO routing, renewal alerts
- Legal & Admin: Document routing, completeness checks, access control

## Developer Snapshot
- Difficulty: Very Low
- Data & Cost: Minimal data; typical build $10K–30K
- Timeline: 2–6 weeks

## Open-Source Tools
- PyKnow (Python), Drools (Java), BPM platforms with rules engines

## Business Impact & ROI
- Time savings: 60–80%; consistent decisions with full audit trail
- Example: HR benefits processing with >100% first-year ROI (see ROI appendix)

## When to Use / Avoid
- Use: Deterministic, auditable processes with well-understood logic
- Avoid: Logic is fuzzy, must adapt from data, or rules change constantly
