üîñ Preface
This booklet is designed for experienced enterprise developers‚Äîprofessionals working on HR, Finance, Procurement, Legal, Admin, and internal IT systems. You are strong builders, and this guide provides a complete readout of AI's progression, from rule-based systems to generative AI, to help you become an effective AI implementer.
It emphasizes history, capabilities, and practical use cases relevant to your domain. We focus on developer difficulty, resource requirements, key open-source tooling, and realistic business outcomes. This is not a guide for buying closed APIs; it's for the developer who wants to build, fine-tune, or optimize AI solutions using open-source technologies.
You are uniquely positioned to improve internal business processes and employee productivity. This guide provides the technical foundation, business framework, and practical roadmap to succeed.

ü§ñ Section 1: Rule-Based Systems (Symbolic AI)
What Are They?
Rule-based systems rely on explicitly encoded human logic‚Äîif-then rules‚Äîrather than learning from data. This was the first wave of AI, prominent from the 1970s as "Expert Systems."
